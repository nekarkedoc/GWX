# GWX

GWX was written on a whim and because there is no IEFBR14 on PCs.

GWX is a C++ Windows Console application that does absolutely nothing, and returns. Useful for certain situations and a replacement for annoying tasks. Name it whatever you wish, and overwrite.

This repository contains the complete Visual Studio 2013 project source - bin/debug contains the dbugable executable, or build a release version if it isn't small enough for ya. You will probably need the .NET Framework V4.5 if you don't already have it installed. You'll find the pre-compiled executable in the ../bin/Release directory. 

I couldn't find anything on the netwebbery that did this, so I wrote it, and at least one person seemed interested, so here it is. IEFBR14 is a mainframe utility program which has existed for decades and does exactly the same thing, IEF being the standard prefix for IBM utilities, and BR14, the conventional mainframe 'return to caller' assembly instruction. Well, that's pretty much what this code does, plus the MS API entry/exit bloat.  

Anyways, hope you find it useful, I certainly did. ;)
